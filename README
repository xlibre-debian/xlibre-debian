XLibre Debian
-------------

Build tools for XLibre Debian
To build, run `make`

NOTE: Once a successful build is done!!!
You'll find everything in `./build`
After that, DO NOT USE `make clean`.
RUN `make distclean get` to redownload everything.
For some reason `make clean` doesn't do enough cleaning and some source is modified even after cleaning.
This is a BUG.
